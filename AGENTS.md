# Safari To-Dos — Agent Briefing

Read this file and the last 2–3 entries of `COLLAB_LOG.md` at the start of every session, and
append a `COLLAB_LOG.md` entry at the end of any session where you changed something. Do it
automatically — the user shouldn't have to ask.

Two AI agents work on this repo at different times: **Claude Code** (reads `CLAUDE.md` →
`@AGENTS.md`) and **Codex/ChatGPT** (reads `AGENTS.md`). Same repo, same `main` branch. Either
agent may build features, fix bugs, or refactor — always check `git log` and the file tree first
so you don't re-scaffold or silently revert the other's work.

## What this is

Internal gamified task tool for **Safari Studios** (small team). Every member has a board column;
tasks move through an approval flow; completing work on time earns XP toward a level/rank. Must
stay lean — not a heavy PM/KPI tool.

**Stack:** Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind · Supabase (Postgres/RLS/Auth/Realtime) ·
@dnd-kit for drag-and-drop · Resend for optional email · deployed on **Vercel** (`main` branch,
`safari-todo-tool.vercel.app`), source on GitHub.

## Core model

**Board** = matrix grid, one column per member, each column split into sections `DAILY`,
`WEEKLY`, `MONTHLY` (IMMINENT was removed in migration 017). Board offers several views
(member rows, table, selection, columns — the Focus view was removed 2026-07-07). Plus
Calendar, Archive, per-user Private todos.

**Status flow** (enforced by DB trigger; simplified in migration 031 — NOTICED was removed):
`ASSIGNED → IN_EDIT → DONE → APPROVED`, plus `REJECTED` and a `NEED_CLARIFICATION` flag.
Assignees may also step BACK one status (`IN_EDIT → ASSIGNED`, `DONE → IN_EDIT`) to undo an
accidental click. The first move into `IN_EDIT` stamps `noticed_at` (12h notice SLA unchanged).
Assignee drives up to `DONE`; only admin/manager can `APPROVE`/`REJECT`/reopen. On approval
the task is archived and XP awarded. **Rejection is final for the member (migration 041):** it
ALWAYS deducts the task's full base XP (clamped ≥0) and stamps `profiles.streak_broken_at` to
break the streak; the member can no longer pull a REJECTED task back to IN_EDIT — only an
admin/manager `reopen_task` can. For an accidental submit, reviewers use the neutral "Back to
IN EDIT (no penalty)" reset instead (plain status update, no XP/streak effect).

**Roles:** `admin` (full control), `manager` (task approval + most admin task rights), `employee`
(= "Member", normal user), `guest` (= "Viewer", read-only). Legacy `user` maps to `employee`.
Per-board visibility via `board_access`. Deactivated users keep data but lose access.

**XP / levels** — cumulative, never resets. **Only ever written server-side** via RPCs, never
from the client. All XP amounts are **admin-configurable** in the single-row `xp_settings`
table (migration 018, edited via Settings → XP Management) — never hardcode XP values:
- `approve_task` (018, redefined in 020 to also regenerate recurring tasks): base = category
  value (Daily/Weekly/Monthly) + priority surcharge (Low/Medium/High), plus a near-deadline bonus
  (completed within a configurable window before the deadline), an early-completion bonus (per full
  day, capped) and a streak bonus (per day, capped). Overdue penalty mirrors the full base and is
  applied on admin review.
- `review_quest` (007): pays a quest's fixed bonus XP on approval.
- `admin_adjust_xp` (012): admin-only manual correction with mandatory reason.

100 XP/level. Ranks: 1–4 Rookie, 5–9 Reliable, 10–19 Executor, 20–34 High Performer, 35–49 Elite,
50+ Safari Legend. Level/rank math: `getLevelInfo`/`getRankForLevel` in [`lib/types.ts`](lib/types.ts).

**Other features:** comments, subtasks/checklists (tickable in the expanded board card and the
task modal), in-app task editing (admin/manager/creator, via TaskForm's edit mode), per-task
reference links, real file uploads on tasks (migration 032: private `task-files` bucket,
`attachments.storage_path`, signed URLs minted client-side; helper `lib/taskFiles.ts`), in-app +
email notifications, quests, admin audit log with filters, soft delete (`deleted_at`,
admin-recoverable). The old `labels` field still exists in the DB but was removed from the UI
(2026-07-12). Templates: admins create/edit (RLS), admins AND managers assign.

**Shift Reports (migrations 023 + 024):** chatters (incl. external ones with NO account) submit
end-of-shift reports at the PUBLIC `/submit-report` page → `/api/shift-report/submit` (service
role, strict server-side validation via `lib/shiftReport.ts`, ≤6 files ≤8 MB into the private
`shift-report-files` bucket). After submitting the chatter gets a secret edit link
(`/submit-report/edit/[token]` → `/api/shift-report/edit`): **max 2 edits within 8h**, both
enforced server-side; every edit notifies active admins/managers in-app (notification type
`shift_report`, old → new diff in the message). Admin/manager read reports at `/reports`
(signed URLs, filters, copy-link, per-report + multi-select **PDF export** via jspdf in
`lib/shiftReportPdf.ts`); admin/manager can **approve/reject** each report (migration 033:
`review_status` PENDING/APPROVED/REJECTED + reviewer/timestamp, filter pills on /reports,
clicking the active decision resets to Pending); admins can hard-delete a report incl. its files
(`/api/shift-report/delete`). The public form also offers a PDF download after submitting.
Models for the form dropdown are managed in Settings → Creators / Models
(`/api/shift-report/creators`, admin-only). `creator_name` is snapshotted at submit time;
`chatter_name` is free text on purpose. The `edit_token` must never be sent to the reports
list — only the submitter gets it. v2 (Anthropic-API screenshot auto-verification) is
deliberately NOT built yet.

**Templates (migration 019):** a template is a NAMED BUNDLE of tasks grouped by Daily/Weekly/
Monthly (`task_templates` = bundle, `template_items` = its tasks). `assign_template()` RPC
instantiates every item as a real recurring task for one member. Editing a template is NOT
retro-applied to already-assigned tasks.

**Recurring tasks (migration 020):** `recurring_enabled` tasks auto-reset — on approval,
`approve_task` spawns a fresh copy for the next period (DAILY +1d / WEEKLY +7d / MONTHLY +1mo)
with an unchecked checklist copy. CUSTOM frequency does not recur.

Full DB schema: [`supabase/migrations/`](supabase/migrations/) — numbered `001`…`041`, run in
order in the Supabase SQL editor (001–040 applied in prod as of 2026-07-19; **041 reject-is-final
written 2026-07-19, pending** — next free number: **042**). Migration 041 adds
`profiles.streak_broken_at` (protected column) and redefines `reject_task` (now 1-arg,
`reject_task(UUID)` — the old `reject_task(UUID, BOOLEAN)` is dropped), `approve_task`
(streak bonus skips days ≤ streak_broken_at) and `enforce_task_status_transitions`
(no member REJECTED→IN_EDIT).
Migration 034 locks down `profiles` (role/xp/level/streak/deactivation are frozen against direct
client writes via the `protect_profile_columns` trigger — only the SECURITY DEFINER admin RPCs may
change them), scopes `subtasks` writes to task access (was `USING (true)`), and restricts
`audit_logs` client inserts to `actor_id = auth.uid()`. Do NOT re-open these. The sidebar shows `APP_VERSION` from `lib/version.ts` — bump its
minor number to match the latest migration whenever a new one ships.
Env vars / deploy steps: [`SETUP.md`](SETUP.md). Compact live status: [`docs/current_status.md`](docs/current_status.md).

API routes are NOT protected by the middleware — every route under `app/api` enforces its own
auth (see each file). The auth pages use the **implicit** flow (`lib/supabase/client.ts`);
don't switch back to PKCE — emailed invite/reset links break (2026-07-09 fix). The
`/set-password`, `/callback` and `/submit-report` routes must stay in the middleware's
`isPublicRoute` list, and the Supabase Redirect URL allowlist must contain
`…/set-password` + `…/callback`.

## Working rules

- Keep Next.js (never revert to Vite). Use the `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` env var names. Never hardcode
  secrets; never write XP from the client.
- Any schema change = a new numbered migration file; tell the user where/when to run it in
  Supabase. Empty states must not crash. Run `npm run build` (Windows: `npm.cmd run build`) and
  fix errors before reporting done.
- **Do not push automatically unless the user explicitly asks.**

## Handoff protocol

1. Start: read the most recent `COLLAB_LOG.md` entries.
2. End (if you changed something non-trivial): append a short entry — what changed, why, and
   anything the other agent must not undo. New migrations must be called out explicitly.
